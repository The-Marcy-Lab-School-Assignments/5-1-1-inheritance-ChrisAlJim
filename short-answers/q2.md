# Question

In a code snippet, demonstrate inheritance by creating two classes where one is the parent class and one is the child class.

In your code example, create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.

# Answer

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  sayHi() {
    console.log("Hi");
  }

  eat() {
    console.log("nom nom nom")
  }
}

class ConspiracyTheorist extends Person{
  constructor(name, age) {
    super(name, age)
  };
/** FEEDBACK: You should remove super from here since it would result in an error! You can only invoke the method in that way inside of the function! */
  super.sayHi() {
    console.log("If you really think about it the Earth is flat and lizards rule the world.")
  }
}

const loco = new ConspiracyTheorist("Billy Bob", 39)
loco.sayHi()
loco.eat()
```
