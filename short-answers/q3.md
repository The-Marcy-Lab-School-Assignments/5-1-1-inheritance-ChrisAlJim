# Question

What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer

Polymorphism is when subclass has a method that has the same name as a method in the superclass but different functionality.

```js
class Student {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  raiseHand() {
    console.log("🖐️🙂");
  }
}

class Nerd extends Student {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }

  raiseHand() {
    console.log("☝️🤓");
  }
}
```
